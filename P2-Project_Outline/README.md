# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We have all been there. With a group of friends, starving, but no one can decide where to eat.
STFU&EAT is the app for people who canâ€™t make decisions on where to eat. 
We will provide a random restaurant recommendation for those hangry moments. 
All local St. Louis CITY restaurants that are under $25 for one person, chains excluded. 
Have more time? Feel free to browse through our full list of restaurants.
