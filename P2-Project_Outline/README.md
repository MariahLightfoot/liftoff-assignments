## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We have all been there. With a group of friends, starving, but no one can decide where to eat.
STFU&EAT is the app for people who canâ€™t make decisions on where to eat. 
We will provide a random restaurant recommendation for those hangry moments. 
All local St. Louis CITY restaurants that are under $25 for one person, chains excluded.
